# AnalytcsProject
Applied predictive logistic and lasso regression methods to given problems. 
This was a **STAT 463 - Regression Analysis** final project assigned to my partner and me. We had random problems with its datasets and were supposed to determine what would be the best analysis to gain insights and solve the problem.
